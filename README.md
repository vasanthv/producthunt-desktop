## About
This is an Electron app in which Product Hunt Web app is loaded in `<webview>`. 

### How is it different from the Product Hunt Web?
This desktop app focuses only on the featured product listing. The homepage of Product Hunt is getting cluttered nowadays, I have removed everything except the date-wise featured products listing, product & profile pages. In short, this app is a minimized version of Product Hunt Web.

*Caution: This app heavily depends on the current DOM structure of the Product Hunt Web, it might break if Product Hunt updates their web. Also, I will do my best to update the app within a few days after the PH website is updated.*

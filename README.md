## About
This is an Electron app in which Product Hunt Web app is loaded in `<webview>`. 

### How is it different from the Product Hunt Web?
This desktop app focuses only on the featured product listing. The homepage of Product Hunt is getting cluttered now-a-days, I have removed everything except the date-wise featured products listing, product & profile pages. In short this app is a minimized version of Product Hunt Web.

*Coming soon for Linux & Windows*
